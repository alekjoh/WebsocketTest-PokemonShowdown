# Websocket Test
Simple Pok√©mon Showdown bot written in Python using websockets. The bot can play random genbattles given an opponents name. Currently the bot just chooses random moves until it loses/wins. Might add sensible decision making in the future.

## How to use
1 Install needed libraries (requests and websockets, the rest is probably included with Python).  
2 Set up the config file (See next segment)  
3 Run main.py. If run with no arguments, 2 bots will battle each other which can be viewed via a link. If run with an argument, the bot will try to challenge that player to a battle.  

## Set up config
To set the bot names, change the username value in the dictionaries in constants.py. If logging is desired, a path to a text file can be specified in the same dictionary. This will log every message that is sent from the websocket server to a textfile. Note that the program currently empties the log files before each battle.
